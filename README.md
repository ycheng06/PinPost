# PinPost
Using Instagram API to build a Pinterest like app.
The idea came to me one day when I was scrolling through my instagram feeds. I realized that
I couldn't save any of the delicious food pictures from restaurants that I want to try. 
I used Instagram's API to get the user's feed and added a pin button to each post so I can
pin posts and view them later.
